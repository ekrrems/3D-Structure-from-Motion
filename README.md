## Project Overview

Welcome to the 3D Structure from Motion project repository! This project helps you to create 3D reconstructions from multiple 2D views. One of the main difficulties in image-based modeling and computer vision is creating a 3D model from 2D images that is as realistic as possible. The development of three-dimensional models from a group of photos is known as 3D reconstruction from multiple photographs.
The process of reconstructing a three-dimensional structure using projections acquired from a succession of photographs from diverse viewpoints is known as Structure from Motion (SfM). This technique produces advanced state-of-the-art findings, but the technique's primary concerns are resilience, precision, completeness, and scalability, which are handled using an incremental approach for the structure from motion.
